Project: Tipper

Tipper is a simple tip calculator. It allows the user to enter the bill amount and pick the tip percentage the user wants. It'll then proceed to display the tip amount and the total amount after tip.

This is a simple project that introduces students into the storyboard and allows me to familizer with Swift.
